232047,Beef Stew With Dried Cherries,"This is a fabulous stew that came from one of the Seattle Junior League cookbooks.  I've tweaked it a bit over the years.  It fills the house with an amazing aroma and tastes as good as it smells.  This takes a while to make, so I often do it on a weekend afternoon and then reheat it later in the week. Although the recipe calls for dried sour cherries, I have also made it with dried bings.",1 (358 g),8

232097,Santa Fe-Tastic Chicken Tortilla Soup,"This is Rachel Ray's.  It is so awesome, I can't think of a single modification....it is perfect.  It is more time consuming than most tortilla soups because of the roasted veggies, but it is totally worth it.  If you wanted to go vegetarian, leave out the chicken, there is so much to this soup it would be great that way.",1 (895 g),4
232099,Scarlett's Crock Pot Cheese (And Prawn) Fondue 2 Die 4!,"Ideal for long hot summer days when you don't feel like cooking and of course the beauty of using a slow cooker (crock pot) is that it doesn't heat the kitchen! The prawns are optional for vegetarian but if you eat fish please add them!  This is sooo fantastic! Serve with crusty bread or crudites or pretzels!  YUM!

232102,Mashed Plantains With Leeks and Fresh Herbs,Adapted from Bon Appetite magazine. Plantains are those big bananas in the supermarket. Often used in Caribbean cooking. They are a starch and must be cooked before eating. In this recipe they are an alternative to mashed potatoes. The original recipe basically had more  butter and sour cream. Increase those if you want a richer dish.,1 (622 g),4
232103,Kosher Jewish  Pickles,"Those of you who had the pleasure of growing up on the East Coast of the United States may have had one of these traditional Kosher pickles, made primarily by Jewish businesses. They are by no means your store bought pickles.  They are even better then your favorite deli's pickles.  These pickles are what all other pickles are founded on; quality.  
DO NOT be scared of making pickles.  This is easy, and I will give it to you in layman's terms.  
In a good authentic Kosher pickle there is no vinegar.  None, not a drop.  What kind of pickle has no vinegar?  A good one.  Think of it this way, a pickle with vinegar is a pickle that could have been really good, but the maker decided to cheat, and quicken the process.  
How long is the process?  5 days, from start to finish.  Too many for you?  Then its time to move on.  Want a fantastic, authentic, Kosher/Jewish pickles?  You have found your recipe.  
Let us begin.

P.S.  The jar. I get my jar(s) by buying a big jar of crap pickles from a food warehouse.  Then I wash it and pour some boiling water in it, and it is ready for use.  I also boil the cap just in case, but have made many batches without ever using boiling water and I have never taken ill.  Only reason I do use the boiling water on occasion is because my wife is around.",1 (408 g),15

202033,Pantry Clearing Chili Bean Soup,"December 26 and the last thing I want to see as another store.  Desparation leads to inspiration and this was the result. A soupy chili with a complex flavor that is part spicy and smokey with slightly sweet undertones from the pineapple.  Since this was a pantry clearing experiment, you should feel free to do the same.  Replace the pink beans with kidney beans or use red peppers instead of green ones.",1 (388 g),8
503579,Ras El Hanout,"There are as many different recipes for this as there are Moroccan cooks; this is the blend I learned in culinary school and it's darn tasty.  This recipe assumes you are using all pre- ground spices, but it's even better if you start with whole spices, toast them, and grind yourself.",1 (2 g),24

412809,Mushroom Lasagna: Gluten Free and Pasta Free!,"Sauteed mushrooms replace traditional lasagna noodles, and their rich flavor and texture more than make up for the absence of meat. Use 3 T. flax seed meal mixed with 1 T. water for egg-free preparation (as noted in the ingredients). Gluten free pasta is available, but because I'm severely vitamin D deficient as a result of Celiac Disease which went undiagnosed for many years, I came up with this in order to take advantage of the vitamin D in mushrooms. The cheese and pasta sauce are the two critical ingredients that will make or break this dish. We have two sauces created by local restaurants that are available in many Ohio grocery stores: LaRosa's and Annarino's. They tie for first place as the best all-purpose sauce I've ever tasted. You might consider looking in your area for a good locally produced sauce ... but maybe we're just really lucky around here! I use Mario Batali Italian Four Cheese Blend because it's outstanding and loaded with flavor.",1 (525 g),4

494714,Ridiculously Easy Chicago-Style Pizza Pie,"Chicago-style pizza is great, but it can be a pain to make and way too expensive to buy from a restaurant... so I came up with this easy-to-make recipe.  The best Chicago pizzas usually feature cornbread crusts, but the pie crusts make a surprisingly tasty substitute!  I use this recipe by Dan-Amer #1 for the sausage (http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-bulk-italian-sausage-chicago-style-329000), but store-bought sausage should work just as well.",1 (343 g),4
232107,Makrout a Louz - Algerian Almond Cakes #2,"Delicious little diamonds of tangy almond delight! Easy to make and very much appreciated by all. Perfect for Eid celebrations or any special (or not so special!) ocassion.

This is for the lemon ones - more traditionally they are lime....

You can freeze these and then put the syrup and icing sugar on later. I like to make a few things in advance so I'm not cooking 24/7 just before Eid etc. I also make these with a mix of 250g desiccated coconut + 100g ground almonds - just as tasty & a fraction of the cost!",1 (921 g),1

232064,Pinto Bean Soup With Fresh Salsa,"Despite its creamy taste, this simply prepared soup is surprisingly low in fat.

It is the perfect antidote to a blustery day, and the fresh, sharp garnish contrasts nicely with the natural richness of the beans.",1 (658 g),6
350688,Roasted Shrimp Cocktail,"This recipe for shrimp cocktail is way better than any cold recipe I have ever tried! I saw it on Food Network by Ina of Barefoot Contessa...

232117,Tiramisu Piemontese,"One of the most celebrated delicious Italian desserts, and my Roman partner Cristiano introduced me to the best possible recipe!!

""Tiramisu"" means ""Pick me up"" in Italian (Tira mi su). I was curious about the origin of this name, and when I asked Cristiano about it, he told me this rich cake full of calories (thus it would give you lots of energy) was served traditionally as a final dessert at weddings (the Italian weddings rival to those of Greeks, they keep on eating and eating all day and night!!). This was done to assure the newly weds' very ""energetic"" and passionate honeymoon following the big feast!!",1 (115 g),12

This recipe also comes from the same cookbook, ""The New Orleans CookBook"" by Rima and Richard Collin.

241799,Praline Cake Filling,"I was looking for a praline cake filling and found this on the internet.  I found the original recipe to be too thick.  While it didn't harden like a praline, it was just simply too thick.  I've adjusted the quantities of milk and powdered sugar in order to have a filling that is spreadable.  After it cools, you may need to thin it with a little more evaporated milk.  If it's too thick start adding one tablespoon at a time until you get a consistency that can easily be spread on a cake without tearing the cake.  You are looking for a consistency that will slowly drip off of your mixing spoon.  There are other recipes for praline fillings that aren't cooked.  However, I find that the cooking of the mixture adds extra flavor and a richness that will not achieve by just mixing the ingredients together.  I love to make a yellow cake and use this filling and ice with a chocolate buttercream frosting and then pour a chocolate ganache over the top of the cake and let it drip down the sides.",1 (1325 g),1

Over the years I have added to the recipe and enhanced it to be not only delicious but nutritious.  My recipe for Shepherd's Pie has almost all the food groups in this casserole.  It is easy to cook and has been a family favorite for years.  This is one way I could get my children to eat vegetables, because the casserole is filled with potatoes and ground beef, their two favorite things to eat.

It is a little time consuming as there is a little prep time, chopping vegetables and also the cooking down of the sauce, but it is well worth it for the end result. My whole family thought it was yummo and kept raving about both the duck with the sauce and how much they loved the parsnip mash, I had gone up to my mum's house for dinner and made this so it was tested out on many and a success all round. I am listing the recipe below for 2 people as I wrote down the ingredients I used when just making for myself and hubby, because it is hard to reduce the sauce amounts without affecting the flavour the sauce would be enough for 4-6 people.

I made the mistake of using leftover hamburger buns instead of following the directions of using sourdough rolls, which would have stood up better to the sauce, resulting in a soggy burger.  This did not affect the wonderful taste, I just would not make this mistake again.  I used an 18-year old balsamic vinegar from Fustini's in this dish and it was wonderful.

383000,Coconut Pecan Torte,"From General Foods Corporation, publication year 1963.  An elegant dessert; layers of ladyfingers and extra rich pudding buttercream. This is not the usual torte, it is more like a charlotte.  The rich filling is a cooked pudding buttercream reminiscent of the classic French buttercream that uses whipped eggs cooked with a hot sugar syrup; & once cooled butter is whipped in. This recipe is almost no cook. The only cooking is the cooking of the pudding. Everything else is assembly and chilling time.  You can use any brand ingredients (even store brands).  This is a brand name publication so it calls for it's own brands.  The buttercream is so good you could even use it to frost a cake.  Double or triple the buttercream for a cake if you wish. You could use different flavors of pudding, leave out the coconut and pecans and make any number of buttercream flavors (chocolate, butterscotch, etc.)  to frost any cake. This cake would have to be stored in the refrigerator, and brought to room temperature to serve.  I use aluminum foil to line the pan, not waxed paper, too difficult to work with. And I do not use Dream Whip.  I toast the pecans before chopping.  One cup of heavy whipping cream, whipped  is what I use to garnish the torte.  And I use half a vanilla bean & not the almond extract.",1 (79 g),12

390060,Reblochon Tarts With Bacon &amp; Fingerling Potatoes,"F&W Magazine, October 2008 edition. Terrence Brenan s the author of this recipe as it originally appeared in this edition. From Pairing of the Day: October 2008, Strategies for Cooking with Cheese. With a golden layer of puff pastry topped by caramelized onions, soft potatoes, bacon and tangy Reblochon cheese, this tart is lighter than the sum of its parts, making for a satisfying fall dish that’s great any time of day. The Reblochon, a washed-rind cheese from France, can be replaced with a robust Taleggio from northern Italy or the smooth French soft-ripened cow’s-milk cheese Saint-Andre. Wine suggestions: the earthy, berry-rich flavors of Pinot Noirs from California’s Santa Lucia Highlands work well as partners for washed-rind cheeses like the Reblochon in this tart. Jason Miller likes to pour the silky 2005 Logan Pinot Noir. The floral 2006 Morgan Twelve Clones is an equally good option Now that I have finished with the preliminaries I have to say these were delicious - with cheese being melted over the caramelized onions was a real treat - to say the least. ;)",1 (128 g),4

293601,Stove Top Smoker Corn-On-The-Cob,"If there's one reason to buy a stove top smoker, this is it.  If I had to actually narrow it down to just one reason, it would be tough, but smoking corn on the cob is definitely in the top five.  The kernels keep their sweetness, which is intensified by smoking, and their crunch and juiciness.  Stripped from the cob-a very simple procedure-the kernels are an amazing
addition to all kinds of salads, soups, and salsas.  When it comes to the most bang for the buck, smoked corn is leader of the pack.  Use the milder wood chips like alder or cherry, or go for the obvious, corn cob chips.  Hickory and Mesquite are quite good also.

211223,Curry Powder Trio (Take Yer Pick!),"Three curry powder mixtures. British manufacturers developed curry powders in an attempt to provide a ready-made spice mixture equivalent to the kari podi (podi means “powder”) that British colonists became accustomed to in southern India. Essential to the fiery cooking of southern India, sambar podi is the combination of spices that evolved into British-style curry powder. Poudre de Colombo came to the French West Indies with Sri Lankans who were taken there to work on the sugar plantations. Japanese curry powder, under the S&B brand, has been produced since 1923, when Minejiro Yamazaki began blending a well-balanced and sweetly aromatic curry powder especially suited to Japanese tastes. For all curry powders, starting with whole spices and lightly toasting them before grinding yields a more fragrant, fresher mixture. *** NOTE *** Columbo is a French version of curry powder, which originated with the Sri Lankan indentured workers in the FWI. it does not carry the heat of many of the other islands. This mixture carries off-beat ingredients such as roasted rice. Roasting gives the rice a nutty flavor and makes it easier to grind. The rice acts as both a flavoring and a natural thickener. Poudre de Columbo makes a great holiday Gift, being one of the lesser-known cuisines of the Caribbean. You also can use it as you would any curry powder.",1 (233 g),1

The unique flavour of the bredie is determined by the vegetable used. Although almost any vegetable can be used the meat is almost always lamb or mutton. Mutton is ideal for bredies as the long slow simmering tenderizes it and brings out the full flavour. Recipes for bredies have been handed down through many generations and they changed very little in character over the years.

I was happy with how this turned out... especially the cheese mixture. No one will know it is soy! The end result isn't as rich as the original version but still quite filling. If you aren't worried about calories you could double the mozzarella and use sausage with the ground beef. You will get 1-2 veggie servings per slice (depending on how much you count as a serving).
I made this in 2 8x8 pans... make one now and freeze one for later. Or half the recipe. Also this could be made vegetarian by replacing the meat with a veggie alternative and made lactose free if you omit the parmesan and replace the mozzarella with rice cheese.",1 (275 g),12

352932,Resveratrol Crunch-N-Munch,"The French Paradox,,,the observation that the French suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease even though having a diet pretty rich in saturated fats.  It is thought that their saving grace is coming from all the red wine that they drink.  Red wine contains resveratrol, a natural substance that has been linked to the prevention of many diseases including cancer and also to healthy life expansion.
I love red wine but I also wanted to see what other foods contain large amounts of the stuff!!  Surprisingly, peanuts!!  I decided to put together a trek mix using some of the tasty resveratrol winners!!!
I find that I enjoy a mix of fruits and nuts with a little salt and a treat like chocolate rather than just a bowl of just nuts or just fruit.  I used salted peanuts to give this mix that hint of salt and balance but you can definitely use raw peanuts along with all of these other raw ingredients.  I hope you like the mix!",1 (39 g),20

162847,"The Perfect Non-Dairy, No-Sugar Spiced Chai","For eons, it seems, I have been experiementing with alternative ingredients to create the perfect cup of dairy free, sugar free spiced chai. 

Soy milk may work with coffee, but not with tea. Soy milk tends to unfortunately spoil tea by overpowering it with a chalky taste. This renders the use of soy milk as a dairy alternative in chai as problematic.

At long last I have come up with what I consider to be the perfect non-dairy, no-sugar chai. The chalky taste of soy milk is avoided with the use of almond milk, which is totally smooth in texture. It is also adequately complex and silky enough to stand in for condensed milk.

Tip: I use Blue Diamond almond milk (vanilla flavor) myself, however any type of almond milk should work. If you do not have access to almond milk off the shelf, almond milk may be made from sratch -- a quick Google search will aid you in this.",1 (31 g),2

The mixture is pureed with a modest amounto of extra-virgin Olive oil and cheese, such as Parrmigiano-Reggiano, to get the finest flavour,  The sauce also is blended with a few tablespoons of fresh lime juice, which bump up the taste even more and enhances the freshness of the cilantro.  The resulting sauce is lighter than most basil pestos and makes an excellent topping for fish, poultry, or flatbread.  If you like, swirl a spoonful into your favorite soup as a flavor-boosting garnish.  If you serve the pesto with pasta, thin it with a bit of the starchy pasta cooking water.  This helps to stretch the pesto (while cutting fat and calories) and gives it more coating power.",1 (163 g),1

Both are delicious, but this one gives you a little head start for perhaps a week-night meal. This is the beauriful deep red sauce that you will find smothering foods coming from the kitchens of fine Mexican restaurants, hopefully to your table. I use this fabulous sauce on things like smothered burritos, enchaladas, and I always simmer chicken and beef in it. The broth will make your sauce rich and on the thicker side. You may add a little water to thin your sauce, if necessary. I also sometimes add just a touch of tequila to give it a little ""zing!"" This makes approximately 9 or 10 cups, but can easily be reduced to a smaller amount. This freezes great. **Note: This is really my hubby's recipe, and he has always added approximately 1 oz. of Hershey's Special Dark chocolate, and as odd as it sounds, it is delicious. So, I'm not going to stand in the way of progress! He says it balances the the sometimes bitterness of the chiles or powder.

346518,Cream of Mushroom Soup,"This came from blitzing the remainders of a mushroom, leek, potato and blue cheese vegetable dish.  I cooked it in a slow cooker but I'm sure it could be sucessfully adapted to be cooked on the hob.  This makes a rather thick soup, add more stock after liquidising if you want it thinner.
The following day - This was a great creamy consistency for soup as soon as it was cooked, however I've just cooled it overnight and reheated it and I have to say that the consistency is too thick for soup (however would make a great mushroom and blue cheese sauce for steak) so if you intend to chill it in my opinion you will need to reduce it with some more chicken stock.",1 (321 g),8

After looking through the reviews at her blog, I see that cooks who used a 6.5 quart crock pot had problems with this cooking too much. My crock pot is a 4 quart size and I have not experienced that problem.  I do think the stirring is a good suggestion and have changed the directions accordingly.   You could use any sausage you want but the sausage does need to be partially cooked or smoked.  Try chicken with artichokes, chicken with apple, kielbaska, Italian, andouille, or whatever sausage your family enjoys.   This uses LEFTOVER rice so plan for that. I love leftovers.  :)    This could be gluten free if you are very careful with your choice of sausage.",1 (574 g),4

251014,Pat's Lasagna Meat Sauce,"A lot of folks have their own good thoughts about lasagna ingredients, (Have you EVER had any BAD lasagna? I haven't!), but they don't always have a standard recipe for the sauce. Here, I've taken a canned spaghetti sauce, (I use Hunt's Garlic and Herb brand -- it tastes good and it's cheap!), and converted it to a nice mellow and hearty meat sauce for lasagna or for any other Italian dish requiring a tomato-based meat sauce. I have used this basic recipe for many years, making slight adjustments to the flavor as I made it each time. For about the past two years, I've decided that now, it's exactly the flavor I want for my large-pan lasagna. The end product does NOT have the tangy, tart flavor of basic spaghetti sauce, in fact, it's almost semi-sweet. I don't usually use the minced garlic in this one but if you like garlic, add all you want. I recommend adding any minced garlic AFTER the sauce has been blended -- sautéing the garlic along with the onions can make the sauce a little bitter. Many times I have used this sauce to make a huge pan of lasagna that I was taking to the homes of loved ones after a funeral. In every instance, it was always well-received by the families and the crowd went for the lasagna before anything else. I never see leftovers. This recipe makes a LOT of sauce but you'll be glad to have the extra in the freezer (I use sturdy, quart zip-lock bags) for spaghetti later at the end of a hectic  day when you don't feel much like cooking -- it goes really well with store-bought meatballs too -- I get the Italian ones at Sam's Club. In any case, I hope you enjoy this Italian meat sauce as much as my own family does.",1 (2774 g),1

This recipe has endless variations; I've posted the most complicated version (it's not that hard) which can then be unmolded for a dramatic presentation. But simpler versions abound -- for example, a timbale made in a springform pan and filled simply with ham, peas and a thick bechamel. Chopped spinach or eggplant could be added to the rice.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I never cook roast lamb in any other way since finding this.  I do follow his ingredients but just cook it in a normal roasting pan with a well fitting lid, (although sometimes I only cook it for 5 or 6 hours, its still meltingly tender by then) then make a gravy from the strained cooking juices.

513179,Milano Cookies by Accident,"I made some sugar cookies one day and because they were too sweet for me I decided to spread some bittersweet chocolate on them to cut the sweetness and WOW, they reminded me of the Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies I loved so much. Only thing you have to remember when making these is to chill the dough very well and cut the cookies off to be baked  as thin as possible. I like crispy cookies anyway and this is the only way I can get the dough hard enough to shave off the cookies with my bench knife. That's the key to these ""sandwich"" cookies. also, I use shortening that is a mix of vegetable and animal fats. That might make a difference in the taste or crispness of these cookies. I'm guessing at the amount of cookies since it depends on the size and shape you make but I've found that this is a soft dough until it's refrigerated and then the roll is kind of a 1"" thick oval so the cookies, when assembled, actually resemble a Milano cookie.",1 (1908 g),1

If you are serving this to more than 6 people then prepare two pork loins.

211592,Chicken Satay Goes to Rio,"This is my third attempt at a main dish recipe for RSC#9. My tasters gave the other two recipes four stars. This one got five. It has been inspired by recipes from Brazil and Malaysia. There are a lot of ingredients and steps, but it really is a chop-it-up and throw-together dish.
You can make it without the palm oil. This ingredient is common in northern Brazil. It gives food a special flavour and colour. There is no substitute. You can find it in markets that specialise in Brazilian imports. The recipe works without it (I tried it that way on purpose), but if you can get it, palm oil is a wonderful addition.
UPDATE: Many thanks to those who reviewed this for RSC#9. Soon after posting it, I realised I forgot to mention the lemon juice. Oops! It's here now and I hope you still like it both ways. :-)",1 (441 g),6

It should come out nice and fluffy and not too sweet (I don't care for overly sweet frosting) although one can always add more sugar. 

I use two packages of Neufchatel Cheese (1/3 less fat cream cheese). It would probably also be good with one package Neufchatel cheese and one light cream cheese. I wouldn't suggest using both light cream cheese, and certainly would not suggest fat free cream cheese. 

This recipe yielded enough to frost two 8x11 sheet cakes very thickly.",1 (52 g),16

These aren’t DH’s favorites because they didn’t explode! He’s SOL, I guess! The site says they are great with cocktails or as an appetizer. Give DH another cocktail! Lol! You can also make them a few hours before serving; just heat the fries in oven at 350°F for seven to ten minutes before serving. Variations: 1) replace dry mint with dry fenugreek leaves; 2) feel free to experiment! For citric acid we used lemon juice although the next time (tomorrow I’m hearing from DH) we’ll use the Vitamin C powder (ascorbic acid) that I purchased for cooking. Story: when DH asked me the first time he made these what he could use for citric acid I immediately thought liquid, not knowing the batter required it in powder form – I was at my desk on food.com after all, sheesh.

100104,Pesche - Italian Peach Wedding Cookies,"Years ago, my grandmother and great-aunt went to Italy for their cousin's daughter's wedding. They ALWAYS tell the story of this glorious table full of these delectable cookies shaped like little peaches. My great-aunt, being the baker of the family, asked her cousin for the recipe. She was told that these lovely little cookies were traditionally served at weddings there in their small Italian village. The recipe itself is quite simple, however, it is the method in which you assemble the cookies that makes these so unique. My great aunt adapted the original filling. In Italy, the peach cookies were filled with cream custard held together at the crease by dark chocolate. Because she needed to make her's in advance, she changes the filling to peach preserves. If you use the traditional cream for the filling, the cookies must be made and eaten THAT DAY. I've left the recipe in her original words. The number of cookies this makes is an ESTIMATE! Will update after I speak to my great-aunt.",1 (2265 g),1

To keep clean up easy use disposable products and the smallest disposable cups you can find, about 1 oz or so work great. Whether taking these somewhere or not I like to place all the cups in a container for easy transfer to the refrigerator and to catch any spills before the shots set.

It is a very versatile recipe so please feel free to experiment by tossing in any other types of nuts or fruits (i.e. dates, raisins, and/or walnuts) to spice it up to your liking.  What makes this a ""Southern"" recipe are the spices that are used. Figs are indigenous to this area (Louisiana) but dried figs would work just as well.  If you are to use dried figs, I would definitely soak them (like you would raisins) for about an hour or more to ""puff them out.""  Note:  Dependent on the baking vessel of your choice, the cooking times will vary.  Rule of thumb: Bake until a toothpick or knife is inserted into the center and comes out clean.  Do not over bake or the ""bread/cake"" will come out dry.  Also, don't forget to grease and lightly flour your baking dish so that the pastry comes out easily when removed after baking.  Let the baking dish fully cool before ""dumping out.""",1 (118 g),10

It was so delicious that all the participants wanted a copy of the recipe.  She served the loaf with her own tomato sauce.  The ingredients blended together so well - and the texture and flavour was so delicious - that I would have been hard-pressed to have guessed all the ingredients.  I only ate it warm, but my guess is that it would also be flavoursome cold with perhaps cucumber, sprouts or baby spinach leaves in a sandwich to take to work next day.  I have since come across a similar recipe in an early 1990s Australian Women's Weekly recipe book.",1 (112 g),10

Also, if you've never made hummus, it's not the most appealing substance when it's in progress, but it really is good when it's done.

349846,"Romesco With Grilled Bread, Spring Onions and Shrimp","From Food & Drink's Best of 2008 list - I am stashing for using once our shrimp, first early maters & spring onions are available. Plan to make with my Recipe#181632 .
The foodies at Food & Drink say: ""Is romesco becoming the new pesto? Just as our obsession with Italian cooking turned that Ligurian sauce of basil, nuts and olive oil into a near-staple, the increasing interest in Spanish cooking is doing the same for romesco, essentially peppers, nuts and tomatoes ground together until they're nearly smooth. If so, it couldn't happen to a nicer sauce. ""Earthy, toothsome, definitely habit-forming, romesco is rough magic in a bowl,"" wrote staff writer Amy Scattergood when she developed this recipe. Romesco can be used in any number of ways -- spooned into a soup, served on fish, or simply smeared on bread. But one of the most traditional uses is in the classic Catalan dish calcotada: grilled bread topped with grilled spring onions and grilled shrimp. In Spain, it's traditionally served only in the spring, but if you ask us, this is good enough to eat any time.""

Mmmm, will be planting onion sets in the next 2 weeks, thinking of this recipe for the first gloriously warm-hot day.

The same oranges I used for the grated peel I also juiced, and the orange flavor is subtle as a result (a juice from concentrate would create a stronger flavor).

This normally serves 4 people (the rule of thumb for fresh shrimp is 1/2 lb. per person), but if you are serving it for more than 4 you may want to increase the amounts and bake in 2 dishes. I serve this dish with lots of french bread and a large green salad. Oh, be sure to have plenty of napkins on hand as it is a little messy to eat since you have to peel the shrimp as you eat them.

A potato masher will yield slightly lumpy sweet potatoes; a food mill will make a perfectly smooth puree.

Millet can be a bit quirky to cook. Unless you steam it for an hour. as you would couscous, millet doesn't cook into even, separate grains.

Plan ahead the roast needs to be refrigerated overnight then brought down to almost room temperature before roasting. If you are serving a large number of guests I strongly suggest to purchase 2,3 or even 4 (3-pound roasts) and cook them all together in a larger roasting pan, the larger-size top rounds tend not to be as good in flavor or tenderness, also increase the beef broth to 8 cups or even a little more for multiple roasts, do not place the roasts on a rack, set them directly in the roasting pan.

Pineau de Charentes is a combination of cognac and freshly pressed juice from very ripe grapes. This product is very common in the Cognac region of France.. But really, it should be more well known because it has some great qualities and it differentiates itself from other wine based aperitifs. The production of Pineau des Charentes is relatively simple. Very ripe grapes are harvested and pressed to produce a sweet must. This is then blended, within a few hours, with cognac to halt any fermentation of the must. The cognac must be aged at least one year to be used in the production. Since, I love chicken livers - when I got this in the mail, I had to try it. However, we used sherry.

197038,Ruby Cranberry Vanilla Sauce,"This is almost jam-like in consistency and has such a knock-out flavor from its simplicity.  You can be versatile with flavorings (rum, brandy, vodka, lemon, lime, or orange peel) and this can be used to fill doughnuts, cupcakes, cookies, or heated and served over pound cakes or cheesecakes.  ...It happens to marry well with French Toast and pancakes (gingerbread pancakes with warm maple syrup, a little whipped cream, a touch of orange zest, and mugs of hot cocoa creates a very beautiful sensation in our kitchen on cold Sunday mornings!)",1 (622 g),1

518610,"Low Cal, No Caffeine Iced Tea","You might find it hard to believe that I conjured up this recipe because I bought a kegerator w/ CO2 system.  Since I have the perfect beverage distribution system, I felt bad hogging it all to myself to fill with only homebrew.  So, I have a a single tap on there for kids to drink from.  And therein lies the problem.  The kids drink lots.. which is good on a hot summers day, except for all the sugar and caffeine that they'd ingest with traditional iced tea.  So this is an iced tea recipe that I will triple and fill up a 3 gallon keg with, that will not lead to supercharged 2 year olds that run into things and bump their heads (as much), or as many bloodcurdling screams of hyper adolescents in the backyard.

303517,Mcpoppa's Big Mac,"If you're like me, you LOVE the McDonalds Big Mac.  At least... the Big Mac that existed 20 years ago!

Today's Big Mac is just as fatty as ever, but super lean on better ingredients and more careful preparation, not to mention that great taste that began the revolution when we were kids - where did it go!?  What you get in the box now is a stale, cluttered mess that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who knows how long.

So, here's THE perfect formula for making the famous Big Mac at home.  As copy-cat recipes go, this one is flawless!  It also includes a recipe for the pivotal Big Mac sauce.  You can use Thousand Island dressing, but I prefer this recipe to the shortcut because it tastes better and closer to the real thing.

And perhaps the best part is that you can control the quality of each ingredient, ensuring that a much more healthy burger reaches your tummy, free from the chemical flavors and smells that McDonalds currently uses in much of their food.",1 (432 g),1

I put them over rice, but you can put them over whatever you want... you can even put them over a nice romaine salad (you can chill the sauce and use it for dressing).  Hope you enjoy, too.  P.S. - I know it seems like this is an awful lot of butter to use, but you'll be making sauce with it, too.",1 (316 g),2

277209,Lentil Loaf,"I had to make this recipe public for my family to see it, so please, if you experience problems let me know.  The original recipe calls for a cup of cooked lentils, but I know that I had more than that.  I believe I cooked one cup of raw lentils and it ended making about 3 cups.  Also, I used 2 tbsp vegetable oil and next time, I think I will only use about 2/3 can evaporated milk.  I also used a 8x8-inch square glass dish, as I didn't think it would fit in a loaf pan.  I couldn't imagine this loaf would set up with only one cup of cooked lentils.  Easily customizable, too.  I think I'll add garlic next time.",1 (121 g),4

This recipe brings back those fond memories. the secret for a crackling crisp coating is to fry fish in small batches. Too many pieces will cool the oil, and the fish will be soggy and greasy. Serve with your favorite chips. The Cod Clan: 
Atlantic pollack, haddock, and hake are among the members of the extensive cod family. Although these fish vary slightly in terms of texture and flavor, one can generally be substituted for another. Small cod are often called scrod and can certainly be used here. Beer is your best bet to accompany this recipe.

Will try both on the gas grill as well as the smoker (when cooking something else LOL). Found this in Sunset's recipe gallery. It is versatile - serve hot or cold - it is simple but I bet has wonderful flavor without being heavy (too miserably hot & humid here for rich food in the summer).

Also you can use normal wheat flour. Without any oil it really does benefit from some chocolate chips. Another thing I like to do is make up the dry mix in batches and put it in jars in bags and then all I need to do is sift it into the wet mix or give the dry mix away as gifts in nice jars.

418359,Raw Food Sauce Recipe Ideas,"Raw food sauces are (you’ve heard this phrase before) delicious and nutritious.  For example, my recipe for raw food Fettuccine Alfredo dresses translucent ribbons of pale green zucchini with a sauce made from soaked cashews and a tasty spice blend.  Believe me; you won’t miss the cream or the butter (or the fat and calories).

If you like your sauces green instead of white, try my raw food Pesto.  Like the original, my recipes calls for basil leaves, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pine nuts.  The only difference is that the pine nuts are raw instead of roasted.

One of my favorite raw food sauce recipes is the Mock Peanut Sauce that I created for Raw Food Made Easy for 1 or 2 People.  Traditionally, this sauce calls for roasted peanuts, but I use raw almond butter instead.  As well as retaining more nutrients, I think raw almond butter actually tastes better in the recipe.

You can make your own almond butter or purchase it in stores.  Just make sure you choose raw almond butter.

Mock Peanut Sauce

• 1/2 cup raw almond butter
• 1/4 cup water
• 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
• 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
• 2 teaspoons tamari
• 1/2 teaspoon crushed garlic
• 1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
• Dash cayenne
• Dash salt
• Place all the ingredients in a blender and process until smooth

This simple raw food sauce can be kept for up to five days in the refrigerator.  Drizzle it over your favorite veggies at lunch or dinner or use it as a dipping sauce to add Asian flair to the crudités your serve at your next party.",1 (223 g),1

A little information on tempeh from Wickpedia:
Tempeh, or Tempe in Javanese, is made by a natural culturing and controlled fermentation process that binds soybeans into a cake form. It is especially popular on the island of Java, where it is a staple source of protein. Like tofu, tempeh is made from soybeans, but tempeh is a whole soybean product with different nutritional characteristics and textural qualities. Tempeh's fermentation process and its retention of the whole bean give it a higher content of protein, dietary fiber and vitamins compared to tofu, as well as firmer texture and stronger flavor. Tofu, however, is thought to be more versatile in dishes. Because of its nutritional value, tempeh is used worldwide in vegetarian cuisine; some consider it to be a meat analogue. Even long before people found and realized its rich nutritional value, tempeh was referred to as “Javanese meat.”",1 (566 g),1

350231,British Chocolate Cheesecake,"This is an awesome no-bake chocolate cheesecake that is quick to whip up and then just needs 3h to chill. It's designed to be made with sweet dark English chocolate (e.g. Bournville), rather than really 'good' 75% brands, or US chocolate so may not work so well with American brands, and it needs quark, which I know is pretty hard to get outside of Europe, so no promises if you end up making it with substitutes!
It is well worth waiting the full time for the cake to set as the flavour is so much better when it's stiff. This was planned to serve 10, but we cut it into 12 and it still took us forever to eat because it's so rich!",1 (61 g),10
362687,Moderately Meaty Cassoulet,"This variation on the French classic has just a little meat, from a smoked ham hock, allowing the flavor of the white beans to shine through.

Even better, they shared it with all the girls in their youth group that night. Everyone loved it. We can't wait to make it again. Although the recipe instructs to let them sit overnight, we found they didn't reach the soft, creamy, melt in your mouth butter mint texture until they had sat for two and half or three days - perhaps because we live in humid Florida. They are just as delicious if you eat them sooner, but have more of a salt-water taffy, chewy, sticky texture. WARNING - Read through the recipe first. Purpleturtle must not have realized what work she was in for.",1 (787 g),1

This is something I came up with to mimic a hearty bean soup, without all the hassle or leftovers. Even drained and rinsed, canned beans are not something I use often - they taste ""off"" to me. The added lemon juice brightens up the canned flavor and I suggest not leaving it out. The vegetables can be varied according to taste. Omit the ham for a vegetarian meal or substitute cooked, crumbled bacon for an even richer flavor.  Don't like Great Northern beans?  Add the variety that pleases you.  Using this recipe as a guide, follow *your* tastebuds.",1 (641 g),2

I have never grown eggplant before because my husband always professed that it is the one vegetable that he did not like.  He insisted that they taste like rubber tires and had brainwash convinced my children that eggplant was inedible.  This spring, when visiting a local garden center, I saw some eggplant seedlings.  Without doing any research, I impulsively picked the healthies looking plant from the bunch and brought it home.  All I wanted was a couple of pretty purple flowers and perhaps a few eggplants that I would cook up for my lunch at the end of the season.  As luck would have it, I bough a Hansel Eggplant whick is a profuse producer.  I also happen to have the perfect conditions for growing eggplant: lots of sun, moist, well drained soil, and manure rich compost.  I have not captured any great flower pictures, but I now have over 20 eggplants on my bush.  As much as I like eggplant, I knew that I could not eat all that this bush is producing and decided I need to make converts of my children and perhaps even my husband!  I can get my kids to eat anything that includes pizza in the name, so I began my campaign with Eggplant Pizza Bites."" --Alea - Posted on www.5dollardinners.com",1 (67 g),5

Instead of just using water to cook the rice, this uses a combination of coconut milk and fresh 2% milk. Evaporated milk, which is more readily available in the Philippines, is fine too.  If you wish to have this for breakfast, use only half of the coconut milk plus some water as stated in the recipe.

I've been searching since then for something close, cause I always got home from school just as she was finishing the fudge. I sure miss hers. So this is kind of close to it. I got it from a NOPSI cookbook they printed and sent out free at the early part of the introduction of the cookbook.

It could easily be spiced up if you like things spicy by adding jalapenos to the cornbread topping.  I used ground turkey the first time, but any ground meat could be used. I used sour cream because my husband doesn't really care for my favorite red enchilada sauce all that much, it helped tame down the ""red"" flavor. 

**After preparing as written, I would have made the following changes:  add a teaspoon or two of sugar to the cornbread mix, add chopped peppers and onions to meat mixture, and personally I'd prefer the straight enchilada sauce and some spice to kick it up. Overall it was a tasty and quick throw-together meal I plan to make again.**

Mochi is made from glutinous rice by pounding steamed rice into dough, creating a more dense version of steamed rice.

The earliest evidence of mochi was in early 8th century literature. At that time, Mochi was a special food eaten only by Nobleman or the emperor at religious or celebratory occasions. They added soybean, adzuki bean, sesame seeds or chestnut to glutinous rice. After the 17th century, growing rice had become far more prevalent, making Mochi more accessible and increasingly popular.",1 (77 g),8

A favorite Asian comfort food.   The packages of noodles usually have 3 bundles in them. You only need one bundle for this recipe. The trick to this recipe is to stir fry the vegetables separately to build the flavors. By frying them individually, the flavor and color of each vegetable is preserved without any cross blending of the other ingredients.

Ever since my little sugar-free stint in August of 2011 (or was it 2012?), I've made it a point to squeeze harder in other places of the grocery budget, so that I can buy maple syrup.  It's my pancake and hot cereal sweetener of choice and we use it sparingly.  (Sometimes I order it from Amazon, using gift cards that I purchased with Swagbucks too!)  The homemade peach syrup calls for 2 peaches, butter and maple syrup with a few dashes of cinnamon.  Again, be warned...you'll never go back to the bottle.  While the hot cakes are cooking away in the skillet or on the griddle, get these peaches simmering away in the butter syrup and they'll be ready just when all the pancakes are ready to serve.

Doing it from scratch is fun to do with your children and the fresh tomatoes, the taste can't compare. I make mine with the seeds in but you can scoop out. I will include the scoop out but know the seeds in, you get the pulp of the tomato and we love that.
If you choose to vary it and not use fresh tomatoes, you can use these variance, depending on if you like it chunky or smooth. 
 For a chunky sauce, use  2 14.5 ounces of diced tomatoes in olive oil and spices with 6 oz can of tomato  paste or for smooth use 1  6 oz can of italian paste, 29 oz of puree and 1 8 oz can  of tomato sauce and for  thick  2 6 oz cans of italian paste with 16 oz of tomato sauce.",1 (218 g),10

The dish also includes plantain, a cousin of the banana that is larger and not as sweet. Plantains must be cooked before eating, and only ripe fruit will have the proper texture for this dish. To select a ripe plantain, choose a finger that is deep yellow and speckled with black or one that is entirely black. If a green plantain is purchased, it may take several weeks to ripen at room temperature. Do not refrigerate the fruit, for this will halt ripening. From the newspaper.",1 (475 g),4

You can vary this with any herbs or spices you wish (the 2-3 teaspoons of fresh herbs can be any combination you prefer, suggested herbs are listed).  The author recommends the yogurt variation when ""you want to eat nothing but salads, but have to work in protein.""

On a Wednesday night mid February 1965, I was asked to come and help my mother; who at the time was the head of the church kitchen, manning the large plates of food rolled out to the monthly meeting of the ""All Saints Men's Club"". I was 9 years old, and to accompany my mother and be a helper at this important dinner was beyond part of my wildest dreams. These beautifully stuffed, double thick pork chops were so tender and juicy, coupled with the basic, but delicious aroma and spices of the stuffing; most of the ""men"" would ask to have two. My mother had planned for 50 men, so there were no coming back for seconds, but this recipe stayed at the pinnacle of the ""Men's Club"" menu for most of my adolescence, preparing this dish year after year. This is not a fancy dish; but it does fill up all empty spots in your stomach and is really perfect made for a few or a crowd. Very easy to put together and can be easily halved or doubled twice. When preparing this for my family now, we just split a chop and enjoy with a vegetable. Go ahead, stuff em' and eat them....and you don't even have to attend the ""Men's Club"".",1 (284 g),6

293800,Chile Relleno Casserole (Lightened up Slightly),"I wanted to make a chile relleno casserole for a potluck, but didn't love any the recipes I saw.  So I combined several recipes and made my own version.  It has lots of green chiles and both jack and longhorn cheese, for maximum Tex-Mex appeal.  The final dish is great to take for a potluck dinner, but can also be served for breakfast and brunch.  It's best just out of the oven when the egg batter is fluffy, but it is still good reheated or even served at room temperature.  

A few notes about the ingredients.  You should try to use the best canned green chiles you can find because they give the casserole most of its flavor.  The whole canned ones from a name brand (e.g. Hatch) work well.  Store-brand diced green chiles will produce a less flavorful result.  Home-roasted and peeled fresh green chiles (like a poblano) would be excellent, but I don't usually have the patience for that.  Also, the tomato/chile sauce I'm referring to for topping the casserole is a Mexican-American brand, El Pato.  It comes in small (8 oz) yellow cans and has a duck (pato?) on the can.  It's quite spicy and is the closest canned product I can find to the relleno sauces I'm used to, which are more tomato-y than a standard enchilada sauce.  Leftover El Pato is great on eggs or tortillas or just about any Mexican dish.  In a pinch, though, you could use red chile enchilada sauce or blend up some Ro-tel until it's not chunky.  Don't substitute plain tomato sauce, it doesn't have enough flavor.",1 (176 g),10
293902,Papou's Fasoverakia (Green Beans),"I grew up watching my Papou make these every week! Even as a child I loved eating a big bowl of these green beans with crusty slices of my YiaYia's bread.

You may believe the amount of olice oil is excessive, but I actually use more than I have indicated in the recipe- my family loves how it blends with the tomato and creates this magical sauce that makes you want to lick the plate clean!",1 (643 g),4

372447,Pot Roast Lamb With Red Wine Herbs and Veg,I made this yesterday for my husband.  i took inspiration for it from aunty mags santorini lamb recipe on zaar.  I used a new enamel roaster tin that o got after searching charity shops/ second hand stores for a casserole dish.  In the end I went to Argos and bought a huge enamel roaster that came with a free smaller one for £20 in the end my lamb actually fit into the free smaller pot ! winner!  I used whatever herbs I had knocking about id dint have any fresh rosemary and was nearly out of dried mint but I did have some fresh oregano and some fresh mint and some dried sage etc. I would say to throw in whatever you have to be honest.  I did use half a bottle of red wine but half way through I topped it up with the other half.  I always feel bad when I have to use a whole bottle for a dinner so I bought myself a bottle so it was fair haha!  I like recycling into another dish so I then made the leftovers of this into a Moroccan style dish which I will be posting later.  I served this with my bacon and olive oil roast potatoes.  Also my camera battery died before I could take picture of it cooked so I only have prep pics sorry! I also opened my thyme honey from my honey moon in Greece which tasted very good,1 (585 g),4

If you have bread flour (high-gluten) you don’t need to use the gluten.  If you don’t have “10 grain” cereal, use any whole grain cereal. Do not use oatmeal, you will have poor results. At the very end of the directions are additional ideas for amendments.",1 (68 g),24

Too many people I know have bread machines but don't use them because they don't know how to do anything but use a mix!  This will make a nice soft loaf as is, and it's also a great jumping off point for experimentation.  Try varying the types of flour, fat, and sugar.

If you substitute lemon juice for lime juice you lose a lot of the flavor.  Getting the right heat and the right distance from the flame takes some experience and experimentation.

For even tastier nachos, make Homemade Tortilla Chips (#4378) using either flour or corn tortillas. It's truly worth the extra time to make the nachos using these homemade chips.

I wasn't too thrilled with the few I found, so came up with this colorful pie.  I have NOT tried to make this with the Hachiya (soft) persimmons and have no idea how it would turn out!  I used Splenda, but the same amount of sugar should work. NOTE: If your persimmons are still hard and have not ripened until they give just slightly to pressure, you may want to increase the stovetop cooking time.  Personally I like it with the persimmons a little crunchy but I was definitely in the minority.  Also, this makes a slightly tart pie.  If you like your pies sweet, increase the Splenda or sugar to 3/4 cup.    UPDATE: I made this pie for a holiday luncheon at work and substituted sugar for the Splenda.  It received rave reviews!        UPDATE 6/25/10: My pie just won RESERVE BEST OF SHOW at the Solano County Fair!  WOOHOO!!!",1 (139 g),6

372200,Penne With Roasted Tomatoes and Fennel,"Marcelle Bienvenu, contributing write for The Times-Picayune, included this exquisite summer pasta salad in her article giving the ""heads up"" that the famous & beloved Creole tomatoes are just about ready to start coming to market. The Creole tomato is a fabulous tomato, a phenomenal workhorse in hot & humid conditions that kill off other tomato plants. In LA it is also imbued with a special rapacious taste that I am praying mine develop in my coastal mater patch.
Fennel bulb - crisp & refreshing like celery but with that bright but gentle licorice-like essence is a wonderful foil for robust tomatoes to accent their sugars. This pasta salad appeals to me because it seem lighter, hence more refreshing, than others loaded down with mayonnaise or store bought ""Italian"" bottled/prepared dressings. Perfect with a pile of chilled shrimp steamed in Old Bay just after being netted. Iced Tea with sprigs of mint or an ice-cold Rolling Rock ( 7 ounce bottles on ice - Pleeeze LOL!) & supper is on the table for deck dining at its best!

You could certainly substitute canned beans for the cooked dried beans and get the same result.  (If you do, don't add any salt, as canned beans are already salted.)  Time for preparation assumes dried beans and excludes the pre-soaking time of 24 hours.  You can use 1-2 cups frozen corn instead of canned if you prefer.  Two cans evaporated milk almost makes 3 cups.  I use that and add half and half to make the 3 cups. I like to garnish this with some plain corn tortilla chips.",1 (459 g),6

This calls for pre-packaged French toast slices - but you can also use your own homemade French toast or just use sweet cinnamon raisin bread, toasted. Just be sure to allow the toast to cool enough to not melt your ice cream (I got impatient when making these as you can see from melting ice cream in the photo).

After cooking and eating this dish I have concluded that this is what I believe to be ""broasted"". By that I mean the meat has been both braised and roasted, not fried in a pressure cooker. The end result is chicken that is so tender, you can almost spread it like schmear on a warm bagel. 
The 2 hour cooking time includes the extra 40 minutes I let it sit in the oven after I turned it off.


In case you are not familiar with Spanish Chorizo, it's not like the Mexican variety. It is a hard sausage, much like a salami or pepperoni.

408628,Sarasota's Twisted Double Layer BLT Sandwich,"I can not take too much credit for this. This was a sandwich served at a small little ""Hole-In-The-Wall"" Bait Shop that also was a ""somewhat"" Restaurant over in the everglades. The owners were originally from NY and worked in some of the top restaurants and gave it all up for FL life in the everglades. Well if you don't know where this place is, you WON'T find it - there is NO street name (a dirt road), NOT on the map, and it basically has NO name. Seafood, gater, burgers, sandwiches and chicken is about it, no steak, no soup, chili now and then -- but 5 star quality. Well, the day I was there I ordered a BLT. Well when it came out ... it wasn't like any BLT I ever had.  It was amazing but so different. Now being a Mom and Pop place in the everglades and 4 picnic tables, I knew I could talk to her and find out the crazy history behind this sandwich. So she sat down and told me the story. She said that is was not her traditional BLT, but she was forced to make some changes. Apparently, their delivery truck broke down so they didn't get their meat or produce. So she decided to improvise. Now, it still had tomatoes, bacon, mayo and lettuce, but this was the result. What a fantastic sandwich. It was served with both regular and sweet potato fries. I had to recreate it.",1 (664 g),2

Since I just made this tonight, it has not had time to properly set, so I am not sure how soft a set it is going to be. Be sure to measure the fruit after chopping. Also, I would not guarantee that this would still work with a different brand of pectin, and it definitely would only work with the no-sugar-needed kind. Preparation time does not include pitting and chopping fruit, as I tend to be very slow at things like that, and cook time includes only cooking time of pectin.

400468,Thin Sandwich Buns,"I've tried to make a low calorie homemade bread for years. When they came out with thin buns, it inspired this recipe. One sandwich bun is 1 Weight Watcher point.

TIPS: You'll need a 4"" biscuit or cookie cutter for these to be consistent. The vital wheat gluten improves the texture and rise, but you don't have to use it. Just add 2 more tablespoons of flour if you omit it. And white flour will work just fine if you don't want whole wheat. Just add more flour in place of the extra bran called for in the recipe. Of course, the nutritional info will be different.

Enjoy!

You can use this sauce with great success over frozen store-bought ravioli, tortelini or stuffed shells. This makes about 4 gallons of sauce. The prep time varies.

The brown sauce listed in the recipe is a simple all-purpose stir-fry brown sauce (if you don't already have a fav, there are a few listed from other chef's). 

Salt and pepper are to taste (or dietary restrictions so no amounts listed).

382107,"Gluten-Free, Yeast Free Bread or Pizza Base","I got the idea for this recipe from another posted on recipezaar. Kept fiddling with it until I've come up with this. It is lighter, though still dense but not as crusty. I change the flours and oils as I feel like it to change the flavour. Do not be tempted to use only one kind of flour, the bread will not have a nice bite, and will be a bit bland.
You can use bread flour or plain white flour mix,(purchased pre mixed). Or your own! I always use 2/3 of one mix, and then add a third of another flour. For instance: 2 cups of white mix, half cup instant polenta and half cup of tapioca or potato flour. OR two cups of dark breadflour mix, plus teff or sorghum(aka jewar), then half cup tapioca or potato flour and half cup of nuts or ground flax seed, and so on. If you mix flours, taste a bit of the flour mix before you go on, if you don't like the taste, don't continue you won't enjoy it once its baked.
For oil I use olive or sesame, and for a white loaf usually corn oil.  You can sprinkle poppy seed or sesame seeds on top.
This recipe is enough for two 12"" pizza bases, but easily halved.",1 (11 g),10
407335,Easy Italian-Style Hummus,"I actually like this much better than regular humus/hummus. It doesn't take long to put together, but tastes best if it has sat for at least 6-8 hours or overnight before serving. Cooking time is the time for the food processor.",1 (181 g),6

445848,Cream of Spinach Soup,"Serve this creamy spinach soup piping hot, with a fresh buttered baguette. Delicious! You can make a vegetarian version by using vegetable stock in place of the chicken stock. Also, you can add a dash of paprika, cayenne, or red pepper flakes if you like more spice. Note: I used a 32 oz. box of organic chicken stock, and we thought it was fine that way (we like ours with plenty of broth). But the three cups of chicken stock that the recipe calls for should work nicely if you like a thick soup, or are going to blend it. I don't have an immersion blender, but feel free to blend this soup if you prefer a smooth version.",1 (391 g),4

106638,Pepper &amp; Vanilla-Marinated Shrimp (Papantla Style),"This unusual (but I think delicious) recipe is purported to originate in the vanilla-producing regions of eastern Mexico. It calls for the use of pure vanilla extract; artificially flavored vanilla extract would be a poor substitute for the real thing. It is very peppery, which we like, but if you want less heat I would begin by cutting the pepper called for in half. Serve over lots of rice, this makes a lovely sauce!

You can bake the raw dough with sauce and cheese on it but I prefer to bake ahead and freeze the crusts so I can just thaw it out then put sauce and toppings on.

323925,Mom's Eggs and Tortillas,"When I studied in Merida, in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, my sophomore year in college, my host mom made something similar to this as a simple supper dish.  In Mexico, lunch is eaten much later than in the US (2 or 3), and supper is often served quite late (8 or 9 in my host family's home).  Lunch is the heaviest meal of the day, and supper is much lighter, sometimes leftovers from lunch, but in my host family's home, it was almost always something quick and simple to put together.  My REAL mom enjoyed this so much when she went to visit me that she started making it at home, with her own adaptations.  When she worked as a cook for Headstart (a government run preschool program), she made this a lot, and the children of Mexican immigrant families really perked up when they saw a more familiar food!  The diced tomato, lime, and cilantro are my mom's additions.  My host mom's version was much simpler.  My host mom always tore up the tortillas by hand, but Mom is pretty attached to her kitchen shears, so she cuts them.  Personally, I prefer the texture created by the jagged edges of the torn tortilla.  I like to throw in some cooked and drained chorizo and a little Oaxaca cheese too!  Oaxaca cheese is a white, easy melting cheese from Mexico.  Fresh mozzarella whips come close to the flavor, but it's not the same.  I miss Merida!",1 (143 g),2

It is comfort food!  If that's what you're looking for, you may enjoy this tasty recipe.

I think it started with grated carrots, caramelized onion and garlic, and went from there.  When my hubby brought them in from the grill, I was pleasantly surprised, that they smelled so great, and tasted awesome.  They taste great on a bun, with lettuce and tomato, but we had them, that night, with buttered bow tie pasta, and a simple salad.  

My husband named them, when we talked about serving them to our grandson, who can be a picky eater.  He said we should give them a fun name, and maybe he would be more willing to eat them.  He suggested ""Circus Burgers"", because of the orange, of the carrot. Well, Joshua loves them, and the name has stuck. :D",1 (122 g),6

The chickpeas are ""hidden"" in the meat loaf, so a bonus for anyone who does not like beans.  I am not a big fan of ketchup, so next time I may try chili sauce....(mind you, the other ingredients masked the taste quite well).  As I was cooking for my DH and myself, I divided the meat mixture into 2 smaller loaf pans and froze one.  The loaf was quite moist, so freshly ground up flaxseed ( 2 T - 1/4 cup) could be an option that I might use for the next time.",1 (276 g),6

19079,Three-Cheese Green Chile Spread,"This is very good! It's ultra thick, so I thinned it out with extra sour cream and a little milk. Also, it's not hot/spicy, so I added more hot sauce and chili powder to taste. I omitted the Monterey Jack and used about 7 1/2 oz of cheddar, a mixture of Cabot extra sharp and Dubliner, plus I doubled the green chiles.

It really turned out well and I wanted to remember next year how I did it. The sugar is a guess because I did it by taste when I was cooking. This is good to drink before adding pectin and would be good for fruit dumplings. It has a long cooking time but I don't want to be accused of not enough; when the fruit is done it's done.,1 (6525 g),1

I fell completely in love with this Elixir Of The Gods. However there were a couple of wee drawbacks, availability and cost. I had/have never seen it anywhere other that the roadside service station we stopped at and it was $2.28 for a very small bottle. This is my not exact but fairly close solution.",1 (597 g),1

When the first frosty fingers of winter descend and the first snow falls, we drop what we are doing and make Snow Cookies.  After our first snow, my friends tell me they thought of us that day as they were sure we were making Snow Cookies.
This dough rolls best when really cold.  Cut into snowflake shapes and dust with powdered sugar, leave plain, or cover with a royal icing and colored sugar sprinkles.  Start a new family tradition and celebrate the cold! Warm up a neighbor while sharing this treat. 
Be sure to put a dot of flour on your nose when you are baking, so everyone knows you worked really hard.  So light a fire, tell stories and munch on delicious Snow Cookies.
Consider adding a couple tablespoons of lemon or some finely chopped coconut to the dough.  Unsure of yield.",1 (714 g),1

This worked great for dinner with a salad, and then as a side with a sandwich the next day for lunch for everyone. The night you make it it won't be as thick. For added thickness add 2 tbs cornstarch mixed first with 2 tbs water. My family thought I had been cooking it in a crockpot all day!",1 (397 g),8

408438,Slow Cooker Sausage and Peppers,"I received this recipe in a weekly email that I've been getting from McCormick's website. I made this one day when I didn't want to spend a lot of time with last minute preparations for our Sunday meal. Italian sausage(sweet or hot) gives so much hardiness to a meal that there seems to be little reason to serve much else. We had this over spaghetti, but it could also be made for a super bowl party, and served from the crock spooned into rolls or buns. Hope you enjoy this as much as we have.",1 (246 g),8

465201,Marvelously Moist Turkey Burgers,"This is the claim of Cooking Light magazine.  They state that turkey is a very lean meat and if you don't compensate for the leanness, you could be eating parched hockey pucks.  They add fat to the meat, but it's the good, heart-healthy fat:  olive oil.  And it makes all the difference in the world to the finished burgers.  Here's what they recommend.",1 (203 g),4

The whole house will smell fabulous while these are baking!",1 (32 g),25
147431,Bartender's Sugar Syrup,"Cocktails and other drinks often list sugar syrup as an ingredient, so having just found a recipe for a yummy sounding cocktail I rushed out to buy some.  Of course you can never find an ingredient when you are particularly looking for it and yes, you’ve guessed it, there was a large gap in the shelf where the sugar syrup should have been!

The  Japanese word for breading the tempura is ""kolomo"" which is an old word that means to dress/wear, so these veggies get to be dressed before they are fried :-)  I just guessed how much vegetables can be covered with this recipe- we fried about as much as would fit into a gallon sized ice cream bucket, including the fish.  The vegetables we used were: potatoes, carrots, onions, mushrooms, zucchini, pumpkin, asparagus, and eggplant, but you can use virtually anything.",1 (79 g),8
245981,English Roast Chicken and Gravy,"This recipe comes from my mother in law, who is from England. My husband ate this every Sunday growing up. It is important to have a meat thermometer handy so you don't have to cut into the chicken to see if it is done, otherwise you will end up with dry chicken.

I love the combination of mushrooms, artichokes and tomatoes plus the buttery taste of fresh rosemary.  Make sure you use a high quality pasta to stand up to this assertive sauce.

Partly because he has alot of meat in his diet and pineapple juice is very alkalizing to the acidity in our body. Also, we had been posted to Thailand and pineapples here are so cheap and sweet here.
It feels wasteful to throw away the pineapple pulp, and since the texture is excellant to make jam, i decided to make it for our yearly Christmas giveaways. I added passionfruit since I love the fragrance, and it turned out to be a perfect combination.

I'll test one half cup wine next time I bake this bread and see what happens and update the recipe if necessary. Finally, I did not add any spices to the bread for the simple reason I wanted to test if I could detect the wine flavor. *Update*- 8 May 2011: if you read Chef Kate's review she explains the recipe well and much better than I ever could.",1 (885 g),1

274237,Giant Bittersweet Chocolate Toffee Cookies,"This recipe (from Bon Appetit) appeared in the cooking section of our paper last Wednesday, and after reading the description, I knew I must make them. They live up to the hype...
""there are times when too much of a good thing is never enough, when the entire bag of chocolate chips you have stuffed in the cupboard, ostensibly for baking, only serves to intensify your craving and ratchet up your crazy factor. I'd demand one of these cookies for my last supper.  Let's be clear: you don't waste these cookies on your kids.  You make them for a dinner party for a bunch of foodie friends""...
I even loved the BATTER of these cookies, and the cookies were as delicious, as promised.  However, a friend made a batch, substituting some ingredients and they were too cloyingly sweet....using premium dark chocolate is key!
The original recipe did not include chocolate chips, and the food writer made the addition of walnuts optional.  I added both, but instead of chips, I used chunks of the same quality chocolate that I used in the batter.

They're lamb meat on skewers, but they are marinated in a distinctive aromatic Malay-style sauce. Because lean leg of lamb is the meat of choice, we prefer to also thread a few fattier pork strips on the skewers. Our S A lamb has no smell, or sometimes just a delicious, faint herb aroma from the bushes they graze on. This is also one of our heirloom pioneer dishes, because the sosaties in this sauce can last for days without refrigeration. (We don't do that these days!)  Absolutely meant for grilling -- but do not let it dry out! Five minutes, then switch the grid, and 5 minutes more over fairly hot coals should do it. Ideal picnic or camping food.",1 (348 g),6

Then add an iceblock to each soup bowl when serving.  If you want to add some spice, add hot pepper sauce, to taste.  Ideally this soup will be chilled for several hours before serving but since most of the ingredients will have come straight out of the fridge, if you don't have much time, 30 minutes chilling time should suffice. Chilling time (passive work time) is included below as the 'cooking time'.  For an alternative flavouring, and to give this dish a Mexican twist, use lime juice and zest instead of orange juice and zest, use chilli powder instead of cinnamon and garnish with slices or segments of lime instead of orange.

This lasagna is very saucy and can be soupy the day it's made (especially if you are using a smaller pan with 12 noodles instead of 15). It still tastes great though. By the second day the noodles will suck up the excess sauce but leave enough so that this lasagna never gets dried out (I can't stand dry lasagna).

It is thought that the Lorne sausage, which also goes by the names of square sausage, sliced sausage or sausage slice, was an invention of the Scottish comedian Tommy Lorne who lived from 1890 and died in 1935. He was born in Kirkintilloch near Glasgow. His birth name was Hugh Gallagher Corcoran. Tommy Lorne performed in many Scottish theatres and often performed in Glasgow and Edinburgh and was much in demand for pantomime. In his own acts he would apply white make-up and wear a short kilt, a glengarry, boots that were far too big for him and a jacket that was short. He spoke in an hilarious high pitched voice. It is thought that Lorne sausages were named after Tommy Lorne because of one of his famous catchphrase: ""sausages are the boys"" - he loved his sausages! He often ate a sausage sandwich between his acts. It has even been suggested that not only were Lorne sausages named after Tommy Lorne and to give people an easy to make sausage sandwich, but that Tommy Lorne was the inventor of the Lorne sausage.",1 (242 g),4

285537,Dog Degenerative Myelopathy Diet,"We found this recipe and thought putting it on recipezaar would help us and others make this in batches. We have a boxer with DM she is doing well and we want to do everything we can to give her a full life.
The basic diet and its components have been checked for balance. In addition to the basic components, we are adding vitamins, minerals and natural herb supplements for which no specific requirement is known or at levels which are to provide a specific pharmacologic effect. Again, we recommend those compounds which scientific evidence supports their efficacy. Used according to the following formula, the diet and compounds should not do any harm and have the potential to do good. By cooking for your dog, you can select healthy products which do not have preservatives and additives which might be harmful. In addition, you have the option to use organically grown foods. If the dietary approach is successful, DM patients may not need to use other medications to prevent further deterioration. It is also possible that this diet might prevent the development of DM in dogs who are presently healthy. These hypotheses will be evident in the future, if they remain true. 
(based upon 1 serving size for 30-50 pounds body weight)
This diet (1 serving for 30-50 pounds body weight) provides approximately 1160-1460 calories per serving. You can substitute poultry meats, beef and lamb for the pork chop. This will alter the composition slightly, mainly by added additional fat. The weight of meat is based upon boneless weight. Most of the items can be prepared in a microwave. Based upon your dogs body weight, you will need to make more or less. For example, if your dog weighs 80 pounds, multiply all the ingredients by 1.5 (can be as high as 2.5 times, though), keeping their relative proportions. This is a starting point. You can also make this portion of the diet in advance, aliquot it into appropriate quantities and freeze it for later use. Just before feeding time, remove the diet from the freezer and thaw in hot (or boiling) water or microwave to defrost.
Using the above diet, approximately 1 serving equals 1 can of commercial dog food. The exact requirements for your dog can be approximated by substituting the diet on that basis. You should weigh your dog each week, if losing weight, increase the amount of the diet given. If gaining weight, cut back on the amount given. Eventually, the correct amount will be clear. The reason why the amount has such a broad range in that ideas about the daily caloric requirements vary. Since many German Shepherds have sensitive stomachs, it may be wise to phase in the new diet by mixing it with their existing food until they have adapted. Start by mixing the diet with their existing food in equal amounts. After 1 week increase the diet to 75% of their food. After another week, switch completely over to the diet. This diet is balanced and high in most of the vitamins and minerals which your dog will need. Any shortcomings will be corrected with the supplements given below as part of the treatment.

Regarding amounts of ingredients for this salad:  Normally I am pretty flexible when giving amounts for salads, but I will say this:  when using bitter greens such as dandelion, or peppery/pungent greens such as arugula, make sure you have enough milder veggies (such as tomato, avocado, cuke, etc.) to counter the sharpness of those greens.",1 (554 g),2

344049,Fried Chorizo With Garlic,"Adapted from a recipe in 'The Australian Women's Weekly's TAPAS antipasto mezze'.  Chorizo sausage - surprisingly NOT in the Zaar Kitchen Dictionary - is a sausage of Spanish origin made from ground pork, garlic and chillies, so if you cannot get chorizo sausages that gives you the general idea: just substitute with a sausage you really like.  The appeal of the dish is certainly going to be largely determined by your choice of sausage; and if you like a bit of heat in your food, either choose a spicy sausage or add something like red pepper flakes in step three. 680g? Well, 500g = 1lb; 750g = 11/2lb, and exact quantities are obviously not crucial here. 5mm? 3mm =1/8 inch and 6mm = 1/4 inch.  Again, the exact size of the slices is not crucial, but be ready to decrease or increase your cooking time according to the thickness of your sausage slices.  You can prepare this recipe to the end of step two earlier in the day (and have the additional ingredients ready) and complete step three just prior to serving.",1 (97 g),8

Recipes vary slightly so I wanted to post my go-to ganache so I can find it every time. And you can easily double or triple this one. My basic ganache uses a 2:1 ratio of dark chocolate to heavy cream, 3:1 ratio of white chocolate to heavy cream, somewhere in between for milk chocolate. Those measurements don't translate perfectly in a measuring cup so the 2:1 ratio is below (most common) The better the chocolate the richer the ganache. I love mixing semi-sweet with bittersweet. At room temperature it's a perfect truffle consistency. It can be flavored with extracts or liquers. Hazelnut extract makes it so yummy!

The only traditional ingredient that gets left out here are the anchovies which we can make up for with other briney flavours! I created this recipe with the entire Mediterranean in mind. Italy, Greece, North Africa will all be represented with their unique flavour profiles. 

Za'atar seasoning originally comes from Arab cuisine and is comprised of thyme, toasted sesame seeds, and ground sumac berries, which grow in the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East, and have a tart, fruity flavour. The mix also includes all the classic 'Italian' herbs; oregano, marjoram, and savory. The herbs and spices play off the heat of the chili to give a nice biting warmth to this sauce. Za'atar is my favourite spice mix at the moment!

I personally think that the original was lacking in salt and spice so I added some Creole seasoning to remedy that. You can also use seasoned salt if you don't want the added spice. The meatballs came out firm and perfectly cooked after 5 1/2 hours. I think next time I will cut some red and green peppers into strips to add to the sauce along with the finely chopped peppers.

You can't use regular pectin when cooking with Splenda, as it requires real sugar to set. However, there are low and no-sugar pectins available. I use Mrs. Wage's Lite Home Jell, but there are others. It turns out just as well, and is diabetic-friendly. I'm sure any berry could be used instead of blackberries.

443093,Fresh Pumpkin Pie,"Prep time does not include time to cook the pumpkins.  That step can be done right before making the pie, or any time up to 6 months in advance, if the puree is frozen.  This is a combination and modification of recipes from my step-mother and 'Healthy Meals in Minutes'.  The recipe calls for fresh-cooked (or frozen) pumpkin puree, which really is best, but you can substitute canned pumpkin if you are pressed for time.  I like the squashed-looking 'Cinderella' pumpkins best for cooking with - the kind used for carving really aren't very good to cook with, unfortunately.  I bake one or two every Fall and freeze the puree to use in recipes for the rest of the year.  I find pumpkin pies made with fresh, rather than canned, pumpkin have a more delicate flavor and smoother texture.  Try it!  I have used the same amount of all kinds of milk - 1%, 2% whole, whipping cream, evaporated, sweetened condensed - and have also substituted up to 1/2 the amount of pumpkin puree with squash or sweet potato puree and can't tell the difference in the final product.",1 (147 g),8

508238,Cranberry Applesauce With Orange and Pears,"Slightly tart cranberry applesauce, a favorite of my step-daughter and my 16-month-old grandchild.  I use orange juice and pears to sweeten the sauce in lieu of granulated sugar.  I finish with a small amount of honey -- so small that the pediatrician cleared this for the grandchild at 6 months.  I use a 6-1/2 quart Le Creuset pot, and puree to desired consistency in a Vitamix.  For the 6-mo.-old, her mom froze this in ice cube trays; today her dad froze this in 1-quart heavy-duty resealable freezer bags.  If you prefer a decidedly sweet sauce, add 1/2 cup brown sugar to the orange juice and heat until sugar has dissolved before adding apple slices, etc., or adjust at the end by adding simple syrup to desired sweetness.

Next time, I want to try baking the nuggets in the sauce, I think they'd be moister that way (because I don't want to deep-fry).

I also cut the dried cherries to one cup, down from two, because I wanted more ""cookie"" and less fruit.

These cheesy and nutty oat flapjacks are very tasty and easy to make; a savoury take on the usual sweet flapjack recipe which normally contains syrup, honey, sugar and fruit. Great for lunch box snacks as well as picnics or as an accompaniment to soups, stews and chili. Try to use a good quality mature Cheddar cheese for that essential ""cheesy"" zing! I have stated porridge oats, however these flapjacks are also wonderful when made with jumbo oats - which are a bit more expensive. To achieve  a ""full"" flavour, it is essential to use both type of nuts; the peanuts give the flapjacks the savoury and almost salty flavour, whilst the pecans or walnuts give a subtle taste, texture and nutty ""bite"" to these little cheese, nut and oat bars!

Mee pok is a type of Chinese noodle that is flat and yellow, often varying in thickness and width. Most hawker stalls (Singapore, Malaysia) mee pok come in two variants- fish ball mee pok (hee wan mee), and minced meat mushroom mee pok (bak chor mee).

The sauce in which you toss the noodles is an important aspect of the dish, and is often considered a representation of the cook's skill and experience. The importance of the sauce in mee pok can be thought of similarly as the sauces that accompany pasta. The sauce consists of four components: chilli, oil, vinegar and other condiments such as soy sauce and pepper.",1 (174 g),4

274601,The Full Monty - F E B -  Full English Breakfast,"A fine British tradition - and a meal to set you up for the day; there is a saying in the UK that goes like this: ""breakfast like a King, lunch like a Queen and have supper like a pauper""! So, what does a typical full English breakfast consist of? One recipe in an Edwardian Cookbook listed a plethora of ingredients that would have graced the table of many a stately home at the turn of the century, to include 7 courses! A modern day FEB is likely to consist of the following: two sausages, two or three rashers of bacon, fried eggs, fried bread, tomato and lashings of mushrooms with black pudding and brown HP sauce to taste. In finer establishments you can even expect additional courses such as cereal, porridge, kippers, toast and jam or marmalade, kedgeree, or devilled kidneys.
Rumour has it that the term 'The Full Monty' is used to refer to these type of breakfasts because Field Marshal Montgomery was rather partial to them. Here is my basic recipe for an FEB, with optional extras! Grill or fry your FEB - and make sure you have acres of hot buttered toast and gallons of English Breakfast Tea! I am NOT suggesting this is what you should eat every morning - but it is a wonderful treat for the weekends, holidays and just when you feel like it.",1 (713 g),1

110089,Pure Key Lime Extract,"Easy to make extract turns the zest of 12 limes into the flavor equivalent of about 60 limes and won't leave bits of zest in your pie, pudding, punch, etc. It also has the benefit of storing much better than zest alone. Stored in a refrigerator this extract will maintain its emerald color and pure key-lime flavor longer. The zested limes can be juiced and the juice can be used immediately or frozen in an ice cube tray for later use; about 3 limes makes 1 cube of juice. One tsp of extract is enough to flavor 2 or 3 cups of liquid, or to replace 1 tsp of fresh zest in a recipe. For those worried about the alcohol content; the alcohol in this extract when used in a proportion of 1 tsp extract to 2 cups of liquid is less than that of 2 tsp vanilla extract in 3 cups liquid (a normal amount used in ice cream for instance). Cooking time includes extraction time and filtering time.",1 (804 g),1

It's a bit different than most North American cucumber salads I've seen as there is no sour cream in it, only a simple oil and vinegar dressing.

It turned out great and I would have never thought to use my leftovers this way! Instead of using oil I prefer to use a butter or olive oil flavored pan spray, which I think is healthier than oil. If you use that, spray the pan with several sprays to ensure enough coating for great browning. Also, I had quite a bit rice leftover, about 2/ 1/4 Cups of rice, so I had to adjust the ingredients some. This recipe should make 2.

The red kidney beans and mushrooms also make it different from the usual cucumber salad, but very delicious. Everytime I make this salad, my husband comes back for seconds and thirds.  I always double the recipe. It makes a wonderful side dish to any meal.

**Note** This is VERY STRONG. If you want to make it less strong, add another 1/2 qt limeade. Any more diminishes the flavor. I recommend using Newman's Own Limeade.

528131,Eggless Chocolate Cookie in a Mug,"Food.com wasn't letting me import this recipe. This is my spin on the original. *** REMINDER the best mug cookies are recipes that have eggs in it!

 Place butter and milk in a coffee cup or mug. Microwave for 30 seconds to melt the butter and warm the milk.  Stir in brown sugar and vanilla extract then mix in flour, chocolate chips and pinch of salt.  Microwave for about 1 minute on HIGH.  Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving. 

This is the BEST  thing ever. I'm always craving something sweet and baking a full sheet of cookies and/or a cake is too much. This is my favorite recipe because it has no egg! It's also pretty moist which I personally like but if it is too gooey try adding a few seconds until you find what works best for you!

479422,Fresh Leprechaun Footprint Salad With Eye of Newt Dressing,"It is a little known fact that clover will spring up where leprechauns walk.  The clover plant is often seen as a weed, a wild plant, something you feed to your pet bunny. But clover can also be a highly nutritious food for people as well.  It's high in protein, vitamins and minerals.  You will want to choose fresh, young tender leaves.  Older leaves can be tough.  Forest Fairies are known to follow leprechauns around and they often lose an eyelash, or two.  Where the eyelash falls lovely little eyelash blossoms appear.  Of course most humans call these clover blossoms but we know better.  The best flavored blossoms are from the Acadian Fairies and are known by their reddish color.   Since Leprechaun footprints are not always available you may use any type of fresh green in this salad but it will lose its magical qualities. Cook time is refrigeration time for dressing.",1 (54 g),8

It's best to set aside a morning to make these and haul someone in the kitchen to help put them together. Although they are not difficult to make, it does go faster if you set up an ""assembly line"". The seasoning given here is what I would consider a minimum but you may want to add more to your taste, especially when it comes to the hot pepper. You could also do half potatoes and half carrots for the filling if you like. The amount this recipe makes is also a guess based on our samosas, which are bigger than bite sized but not as big as you get in some Indian shops. If you don't have a deep fryer, you could use a wok instead. If you are really set on doing a healthier version, you could brush these with oil and bake in an oven until browned on both sides, however the texture of the dough is not as good as if you fry them. If you choose the baking option, you may also have to brush them with oil a few times and flip at least once to get them reasonably browned all over.

This ""good luck"" tradition apparently dates back to the American Civil War. Northern troops would often strip the countryside of all stored food, crops, and livestock and destroy whatever they couldn't carry away. At that time, these northern soldiers considered cow peas as ""field peas,"" only suitable for animal feed and as a result, didn't steal or destroy black-eyed peas.

Whole wheat tortillas are best for this quesadilla recipe, since they add quite a bit of fiber. But if you can't find whole wheat tortillas, feel free to substitute regular flour tortillas, low-carb tortillas or even spinach tortillas.

If you don't have kale, feel free to substitute spinach. But if you can get it, it's worth it to use the kale, because it is just packed with nutrients.",1 (77 g),4

Usually it is sold in bags there, and is much less expensive.

You can put whatever you want on top of it. Things I like to add are: dark soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, roasted peanuts, grated ginger, green onion slivers, 1,000 year-old eggs or hard-boiled eggs, baked tofu, preserved Chinese vegetables, green peas, cilantro, etc. Left-over meat scraps go well too.",1 (1041 g),2
